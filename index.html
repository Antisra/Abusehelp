        <p>There is no system put in place to help anyone— just further abuse, side with their abusers, use them as a RAMCOA Mkultra lab rat, lock you up for the rest of your life, take your life, drive you insane, label you, drug you, and gaslight you. Or pretty much, there's only systems put in place to help traumatize you and create an issue that isn't already there.</p>

<h2> For anyone in any not ideal situation. Especially those who need to escape abuse or already have and are homeless. Also for those who are trying to figure out why they're being targeted/abused by society.</h2>
<h3> <em>All abusers MUST fall shall be the whole of the law</em></h3>
<p>You may be wondering who Antisra is. Well, I am someone who's known as “the kid who has 2000 videos of abuse evidence but couldn't get any help.” That's because there is no help. Just a system put in place to help brainwash you into believing your abuse is your fault and further abuse and traumatize you. Just a system to take you through RAMCOA, MKultra, help your parents abuse you, abuse you themselves, create an issue that isn't already there/Munchausen by proxy, drug you, label you, drive you insane, take your life or drive you to take your own, make you a statistic, and use you as an experimental labor rat. There is no “help.” These systems are what I've pieced together as the cash for k1ds and human cash 🐄 systems. They're also all legal tr@fficking which is funded by taxpayer dollars, and nobody cares because “that's where the bad and/or crazy people go.”

Mandated reporters are $ for k1ds system staff, for example. They're there to help your abusers further gaslight you and tr@ff you.

Whenever someone is being abused, everyone knows. The neighbors, police, CPS (which being in their custody is being homeless and tr@fficked), the school, etc., all know. Nobody wants to get involved because they don't care, they're scared to get involved, or they get paid to help abuse you. They're flying monkeys or enablers working with your abusers. And overall, there are laws purposely put in place to keep people of all ages stuck in abuse by organizations and family, but especially youth and women, due to ageist principles rooted in flipped-around religious principles.

When two or more people are working together against you, that is called a demonic confederacy. Flying monkeys and enablers work with your abusers, who are marine kingdom agents or Jezebels, which is now called “narcissists” and other bullcrap psych labels, against you. Flying monkeys are like the random people in society who usually will chime in on your abuse and get nothing in return for it, unlike human $ 🐄 system staff. Like when your abusers report you as a missing person to smear campaign you and reel you back in, the people who comment under those posts with prayer emojis saying things like “bad kids won't listen and stay at home and would rather be grown. Whenever a kid isn't at home, they're missing. I pray they'll be returned home soon.” These people are flying monkeys and will even turn you in for absolutely nothing. They're also doing witchcraft because they're praying their will over you to get you back into danger or human tr@ff. Enablers are people who were sometimes abused by the head abuser, like the head Jezebel mom or dad, themselves before. Now they have the “it's better you than me” and “if you can't beat them, join them” mindset. I've recently found out about a psychological study that coined the term “lucifer effect,” and it's very obvious that the demonic confederacy, enablers, and flying monkeys are all under this “lucifer effect.”

• Anointed and prophetic, or now called gifted, neurodivergent, or empath people are targeted by these systems and random people. I also believe this is what many people are talking about when they say they're a “targeted individual.” There's also people who use this term that are actively being harassed and harmed by bloodlines, organizations, and just rich abusers they're constantly trying to get away from. Also, the “world” has altars that they have to feed with blood and experiments they have to do, so they need people they can take to do these. And who could be easier to take for this stuff other than already hated, abused, neglected, homeless, and kidnapped people?

And as a last thing, I also know that there's many laws put in place that make escaping abuse and running away illegal and very difficult. From ageism to the risk of having rich abusers that can get a private investigator. From missing white woman syndrome, to the fact the FBI may automatically get involved if you're 14 or younger. To the fact you get charged and go to jail for it if you're under 18, you get locked up If you're in a conservatorship or guardianship or similar, and your abusers always have the right to get you locked up. Plus being homeless has never been legal. There's also m@rtial l@w and 🧊 agents everywhere, and they've been an issue discussed since 2021 when it comes to them putting abuse escapees and all homeless people at risk, because them and church vans have been kidnapping homeless people for experiments, to take their lives, and put them in labor tr@ff for longer than people know. Especially the church van phenomenon has been talked about for well over 20 years. So, there needs to be actual advice and harm reduction for all abuse escapees.</p>
<p>Youtube Bio:I talk about the injustices against all people. I show the spiritual sides of it. 1 Abuse is a demonic ritual. 2 The point of trauma is mind control. The height of Luciferianism is abuse, and all of this is done to thin the veil and let over darkness/the demonic. <br> <br> Child abuse is an agenda, not a coincidence. Abuse is a key part in creating a communist society, because if you turn out and traumatize the kids, they never become functioning adults that can think for themselves. So, they will go along with any agenda that's pushed. Abuse is a multi-billion dollar industry called the cash-for-kids and ppl cash cow systems. Abuse creates holes/voids/fractures in the soul (the empty feeling broken ppl have that they fill with drugs, relationships/unhealthy coping) which let in spirits. The spirits + brain damage = "mental illness"/trauma. Many fractures/legion cause insanity. Psychiatry: a racial eugenics agenda run by occultist pedophiles to profit off of abused kids, like all other branches of the cash-for-kids system.</P>
